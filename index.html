        <p>
          There are some questions that are really easily posed, have and
          obvious answer, but are in fact really, really hard to answer in a
          mathematically satisfactory way. One example is: <br />

          <i class="p-center"> How many wholes does a doughnut have? </i>

          The intuitive, and correct, answer is <em> ONE </em>. But, in order to
          prove this, we will have to formalize the questions in a
          mathematically correct language. The key fact is that <br />

          <i class="p-center">
            the rules of geometry and calculus fail over weird spaces.</i
          >
        </p>

        <h2>Homology</h2>

        <p>
          Homology answers two questions. How to define what a hole is and how
          to distinguish between different types of holes. For example, consider
          a sphere and a circle. Both have a hole, but the hole in the sphere
          is, in a certain way, higher dimensional. The idea behing the homology
          can be described using the following myth:
        </p>

        <p>
          Given a certain loop on a space, there is always a region of space
          that it bounds. This is false, in general. For example, if we consider
          that our loop is on a doughnut, there is no region bounding it. Why?
        </p>

        <em class="p-center"> Because there is a hole! </em>

        <p>
          But let us be precise, when we say loop, we mean a k-chain. That is, a
          continuous map from the unit interval cross itself k times to our
          shape. For example, a 1-chain is a curve. A 2-chain is a curvy square.
          A 3-chain is a curvy cube with the insied filled in.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can now define the boundary of a k-chain c (with the intuitive
          meaning) which is a (k-1)-chain. With this language, a hole is a chain
          with zero boundary that's not the boundary of anything else.

          <i class="p-center">
            A hole is a chain with zero boundary that's not the boundary of
            anything else.</i
          >
          This fact defines a group called <em> k-th homology group</em>, which
          can be used to count the holes. For example,
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, in the case of a doughnut, it can be proven that its
          1-homology group over the real numbers has dimension 1, this means
          that it has one (one-dimensional) hole. But, in contrast, the sphere's
          1-homology group has dimension 0. However, its 2-homology group has
          dimension 1, i.e it has one (2-dimensional) hole.
        </p>
        <h2>Cohomology</h2>

        <p>
          Here comes the more surprising part. Cohomology detects holes in a
          space by studying functions defined on that space. The idea behing the
          cohomology can be described using the following myth:
        </p>

        <p>
          If a function has derivative zero, then it is constant. That's false,
          in general. For example, if we define a function from the reals minus
          the zero to the reals being constant 1 at the negatives and constant
          equal 2 at the positives, then its derivative is zero everywhere. But
          the function is not constant, and this is because there is a hole at
          0. We can use this as a test to detect 0-dimensional holes.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, what about higher dimensional holes? This is a little bit subtle,
          and we will not deepen in that direction. There is whole theory of
          differential forms which is needed. This forms define a cochain
          complex which is, in some sense, dual to the chain complex defined in
          the previous section. Insted of having a going-down arrow called
          boundary, here we have a going-up arrow called exterior derivative.
          The lack of certain properties attached to this exterior derivative
          can be used to detect holes through some groups called
          <em> De Rham cohomology groups.</em> The key fact here is that, <br />

          <i class="p-center">
            A hole is a form with zero derivative that's not the derivative of
            anything else.
          </i>
          Does it looks familiar?
        </p>

        <h2>De Rham's theorem</h2>

        <p>
          This theorem says that the k-th homology group and the k-th cohomology
          group are isomorphic, and the isomorphism is given by the integral.
          This is, to be honest, mindblowing. The meaning of this theorem is
          that both ways of measuring holes actually measure the same holes!
          This is very deep, because it links two fields of mathematics,
          geometry and calculus.
